          <h2>My Strategic Journey into IT and Cybersecurity</h2>
          <h3>Building a Strong Foundation for a Future in Cybersecurity</h3>
          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            I'm an aspiring IT professional with a focused drive towards
            cybersecurity. My journey is marked by a commitment to building a
            solid foundation in IT support and infrastructure, recognizing that
            practical experience is crucial for long-term success in
            cybersecurity.
          </p>
          <p>
            My career transition is driven by a desire to make a meaningful
            impact in technology, with a long-term goal of specializing in
            cybersecurity.
          </p>

          <h4>From Finance to Boxing to IT</h4>
          <p>
            For about 10 years, I worked on financial transactions for various
            investment firms. I reconciled trading activity, booked deals, and
            managed contracts.
          </p>
          <p>
            My path has been unconventional, leading from finance to coaching
            boxing, and now to leveraging Wireshark for network analysis.
          </p>

          <h4>A Drive for Deeper Understanding</h4>
          <p>
            As a back-/middle-office analyst, I went beyond my role's
            requirements to gain a comprehensive understanding of the financial
            ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I dedicated three years to self-study, mastering graduate-level
            finance and earning the <strong>CFA</strong> charter, which provided
            me with a deep understanding of the investment industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite my efforts, I realized that the finance environment wasn't
            aligned with my professional aspirations.
          </p>

          <h4>Exploring New Avenues</h4>
          <p>
            After leaving Wall Street, I explored data analytics, completing
            significant graduate-level coursework. However, I sought a career
            beyond spreadsheets and cubicles. I then turned to web development,
            drawn to its creative and problem-solving aspects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around this time, I reconnected with boxing, and I offered my
            services to a local gym for social media marketing. The pandemic
            presented a challenge, forcing the gym to close.
          </p>

          <h4>Adapting and Leading</h4>
          <p>
            I collaborated with the owner to launch virtual training sessions,
            which helped maintain client engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the gym reopened, I connected with clients, and one encouraged
            me to start my own gym.
          </p>
          <p>
            I accepted his offer of seed money, secured a location, and equipped
            the gym. Unexpectedly, my partner left, leaving me to manage the
            business independently.
          </p>
          <p>
            I embraced the opportunity, teaching boxing technique and focusing
            on helping people overcome mental obstacles and build discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            This experience reinforced the importance of mindset, resilience,
            and adaptability for success.
          </p>

          <h4>Returning to Tech with a Focus</h4>
          <p>
            Having completed a web development bootcamp, I recognized the need
            to strengthen my foundational knowledge, particularly in data
            structures and algorithms.
          </p>
          <p>
            A podcast about cybersecurity and ethical hacking sparked my
            interest in the field, highlighting the growing importance of
            digital security.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired, I earned the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
            and enrolled in a
            <strong>Bachelor of Cybersecurity and Information Assurance</strong>
            program at WGU.
          </p>

          <h4>Present Day: Building a Foundation in IT Support</h4>
          <p>
            Cybersecurity demands the qualities I've cultivated throughout my
            career: critical thinking, vigilance, and strategic action.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm now focusing on gaining practical experience in IT support to
            complement my cybersecurity studies. I believe this hands-on
            experience is essential for a successful transition into
            cybersecurity.
          </p>

          <h4>Certifications and Achievements</h4>
          <p>
            My approach to IT and cybersecurity has been methodical and focused.
            To ensure a strong foundation, I've earned the following
            certifications:
